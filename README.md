<h1>ExampleAPI</h1>
This is simple api i'm building using:
asp.net core, entity framework core, sql server and couple bits more.
This is just to test my knowledge in building APIs and adding additional functionality
for future, larger projects where i'm planning to expose some sort of API as part of them :)
